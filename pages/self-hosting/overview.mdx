# Self Hosting Overview

LearnHouse is open source software and can be installed and maintained on just about any Cloud provider. We also support different hosting schemas like using AWS S3 or CloudFlare R2 for content storage.

### Quick Start

**TLDR**: `cp .env.example .env` and run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` and inspect the logs, should be ready to go in less than 2 mins

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10+ and Docker Compose 2.0+
- At least 2GB RAM
- 10GB+ disk space
- A domain name (optional, for production; use `localhost` for local development)

## LearnHouse Cloud vs Self Hosting

A common question we get from developers is whether they should use our official platform, or host the codebase on their own server independently. Deciding which option is best for you comes with some nuance, so below is a breakdown of the differences to help you decide what will fit your needs best.

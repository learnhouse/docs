#  Configuration
For self hosted LearnHouse users, a custom configuration file can be used to suit your needs.
##  Backend config file
Here is an example of the `config.yaml` file :
```json filename="config.yaml" copy
site_name: LearnHouse
site_description: LearnHouse is an open-source platform tailored for learning experiences.
contact_email: hi@learnhouse.app

hosting_config:
  domain: learnhouse.app
  ssl: true
  allowed_origins:
    - http://localhost:3000
    - http://localhost:3001
  cookies_config:
    domain: ".localhost"
  allowed_regexp: '\b((?:https?://)[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*)\b'

database_config:
  sql_connection_string: postgresql://learnhouse:learnhouse@postgresql:5432/learnhouse
```
You can also use a `.env` file to configure your backend.

If an environment variable is set, it will override the value in the `config.yaml` file, here is an example of the `.env` file :

```env filename=".env" copy
LEARNHOUSE_SITE_NAME=LearnHouse
LEARNHOUSE_SITE_DESCRIPTION=LearnHouse is an open-source platform tailored for learning experiences.
LEARNHOUSE_CONTACT_EMAIL=hi@learnhouse.app 
LEARNHOUSE_DOMAIN=learnhouse.app
LEARNHOUSE_SSL=true
LEARNHOUSE_USE_DEFAULT_ORG=true
LEARNHOUSE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
LEARNHOUSE_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.localhost
LEARNHOUSE_ALLOWED_REGEXP=\b((?:https?://)[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*)\b
LEARNHOUSE_SELF_HOSTED=false
LEARNHOUSE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://learnhouse:learnhouse@postgresql:5432/learnhouse

```

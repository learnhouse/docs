# Self hosting guide 

We use Docker & Docker Compose to run LearnHouse, this makes it easy to run the application on any machine that has Docker installed.

Tested on: 
- macOS Sonoma 
- Ubuntu 23.04 Lunar lobster 
- (Need testers on Windows)

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Step by step

<Steps>
 
### Install Docker
 
To install Docker, follow the instructions for your operating system on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Download the LearnHouse repository

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/learnhouse/learnhouse 
```
 
#### Go to the directory 

```shell copy 
cd learnhouse
```

### Configure NextAuth

Add these lines to your `.env` file. A template is available under `/extra/example-learnhouse-conf.env`.

<Callout type="info">
To safely encrypt tokens and email hashes, you need a NextAuth secret.

To create one, either run `npx auth secret`, or on UNIX based systems (MacOS/Linux) you can use `openssl rand -base64 33`.

Copy this string into your .env file as NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
</Callout>

```env filename=".env"
# NextAuth Configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET={generated_secret}
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/
```

### Build and run LearnHouse

```shell copy
docker-compose up -d
```

### Access LearnHouse

When running the application for the first time, an admin account and organization is created for you, look for the admin credentials in the logs.

#### Login to your account 

Open your browser and go to [http://localhost/login](http://localhost/login) to access the application.

#### Change your password

After logging in, don't forget to [change your password](http://localhost/dash/user-account/settings/security) 

<Callout type="warning" >
  It is important to change the default password to a another one, reducing the risk of unauthorized access if your server is compromised.
</Callout>

### You're all set!

Thanks for using LearnHouse ðŸŽ‰ 

</Steps>
## Further configuration

You should be ready to go when following the steps above but if you'd live to enable features like **AI**, **Emails**, **Multi-org**, or customize the application, check the [configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration).

### Environment variables usage with the LearnHouse Docker image

You can mix frontend and backend env vars defined in the COnfiguration page, in a single file like the one included on the repository (extra/example-learnhouse-conf.env)

```env filename="extra/example-learnhouse-conf.env" copy
# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=default
# Backend
LEARNHOUSE_COOKIE_DOMAIN=.localhost
LEARNHOUSE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://learnhouse:learnhouse@db:5432/learnhouse
LEARNHOUSE_REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING=redis://redis:6379/learnhouse
```

```yaml filename="docker-compose.yml" {7-8} copy
app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/learnhouse
    env_file:
      - ./extra/example-learnhouse-conf.env
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
      redis:
        condition: service_healthy
```

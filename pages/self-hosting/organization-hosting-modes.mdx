# Organization Hosting Modes

<Callout type="warning">Multi Organization setup is still work in progress </Callout>

LearnHouse supports Multi Organizations (Multi-Tenacy), which means you can have multiple organizations using the same platform and therefore the same instance of LearnHouse.

Your Organizations will share the same database and have their content, files, users on the database marked by `organization_id` and every request will be scoped to that organization.

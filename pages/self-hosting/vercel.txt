# Using Vercel as Frontend

<Callout type="warning" >
  This is a draft - it should not be published without core team approval. 
</Callout>
<br>

<Callout type="info" >
  It's important to note that you can't use Vercel for frontend & backend. Vercel is only hosting the frontend.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flearnhouse%2Flearnhouse)
Create or log into your Vercel account and clone the repository automatically by clicking on this button.

### Add Environmental Variables

In Vercel project settings go to `Settings > Environmental Variables` and paste this .env file into any textbox.

```env filename="settings/environmental variables" {1-2}
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_MULTI_ORG=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEARNHOUSE_DEFAULT_ORG=defaultorg
```

<Callout type="warning">
  You must have a backend to work with the frontend. Vercel will not and can not run the backend of this project.

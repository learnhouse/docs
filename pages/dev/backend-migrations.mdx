# Backend Migrations

This is a guide to use migrations for LearnHouse, it will walk you through the process of using migrations in the backend.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Python 3.12.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/)
- macOS, Linux or Windows

<Callout type="info">
  For details on setting up the backend dev environment, see [Setting Up Your Dev Environment](/dev/setup-dev-environment)
</Callout>

## General Concepts

Generally, we use Alembic for SQL migrations.
Make sure to check out their [tutorial](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html) if you have never used it before.

## Adding Migrations

<Steps>

### Navigate to your backend directory at `apps/api`

Then use the following command to indicate that the database is already using the newest state.

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure that the production app (in the container stack) was running at least once.
  This way, you can guarantee that the DB is up-to-date.
</Callout>

```bash
poetry run alembic stamp head
```

### Perform Changes In The DB

Perform any change on the schema of the database, you could add a table for the "Example" feature, for instance.
To generate a revision with the changes you did on your DB.

```bash
poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Example"
```

### Check Migrations History

Check your migrations history

```bash
poetry run alembic history
```

### Perform all the Migrations

Do all the migrations

```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

In order to check the migrations, visit a local directory that maps to [this path](https://github.com/learnhouse/learnhouse/tree/dev/apps/api/migrations).

</Steps>


<Callout type="info">
  For downgrading the latest migration, you can use `alembic downgrade -2`.
  Make sure to consult the Alembic docs for further information.

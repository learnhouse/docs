# Trail

Trails are a key feature on Learnhouse that enables teachers & students to track their progress through Courses.

By using Trails, teachers can effectively use quiz results and text-based course progression to tailor feedback in-person & remotely. It also lets students keep a track of their own progression through the course, and encourage increased self-determination & confidence.

By using this feature, teachers or course content creators can collaboratively view and track student progress to address weak spots in content, to aid with revision, and for consolidation further down in the course.

Learnhouse's dynamic feature for progress tracking, offering real-time analytics and an adaptive feedback system. It facilitates seamless collaboration between teachers and students, enabling interactive feedback and collaborative content enhancement. Empowering students, Trails encourage self-tracking, reflection, and confidence building. This holistic learning experience includes targeted revision, consolidation, and continuous improvement, ensuring an adaptive and transformative educational journey for all.

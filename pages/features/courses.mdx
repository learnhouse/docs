Courses can be part of a Collection, saving users time and effort by accessing all relevant courses in one place, instead of having to search for them individually. In addition, collections can serve as a tool for instructors and administrators to provide a more structured and coherent learning experience to their learners, by grouping courses in a logical and meaningful way. 

When **Starting a new Course**, progression data is stored in your Trail including Quizzes data and Assignments. (Coming soon)
